Phase 3 Submission

To compile make sure the JDBC are alongside all the java files and compile them all separatley.

javac Olympics.java
javac driver.java
javac userinterface.java

Then you can simply run them all individually either driver or userinterface by just doing java <class-name>. Olympics.java will never be directly ran.
